      <h3>About Neighborhood Sounds</h3>
      <p>See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Now then, let's play. What the devil. </p>
      <p>Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. </p>
